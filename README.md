# Real-Estate-Management-System

I found part of this website on the net. I modified the websites functionality a bit more and added an Admin module to it.
This website makes use of HTML CSS JavaScript as Frontend with PHP and MYSQL as backend.


### If you dont know how to run this

1) INstall XAMPP server
2) clone this project in the C:\xampp\htdocs || If you dont clone then just download the zip file and then extract inside XAMPP folder C:\xampp\htdocs
3) Open the XAMPP control panel
4) start the apache and mysql server
5) open my phpmyadmin(click on admin button corresponding to MYSQL on the XAMPP control panel)
6) create a new data-base with the name "housing-co"
7) import the 'housing-co.sql' file into the data-base
8) go to the address bar of the browser type the address of your folder in htdocs. For eg My code is stored in C:\xampp\htdocs\Real Estate. therfore -> 'localhost/Real Estate/index.html'

hope you like it :)
